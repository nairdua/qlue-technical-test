# SimpleDash

**SimpleDash** is a dashboard mockup made for the Qlue front-end internship selection process.


For now, it consists of a homepage plus (fake) user and post views, with each view consisting
of a table list of the corresponding data and (if possible) data visualization in the form of charts and maps.

There is
also a navigation bar that allows you to quickly move between pages.

3. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.
